LangPy is a library for modelling linguistic competition and decline. There are 3 models available to the user: the Abrams-Strogatz model, the Castello model and the Mira model. Each model allows for different levels of fine-tuning based on desired scenarios. Please refer to the LangPy PDF for more information. Please feel free to improve upon the code in any way!
